Operational Implementation Plan: The Pathway "Mission Analysis" Engine
Executive Summary of Updates
This updated plan restructures the technical architecture to align strictly with the Pathway Property Business Logic (Street Level vs. Asset Level) and the Military Guide Framework.
Key Architectural Shift: The system is no longer a linear document processor. It is now a Hierarchical Decision Engine.
Phase 1 (Street Level): A low-cost, high-speed "Gatekeeper" that filters opportunities based on macro factors (Social Housing, Flight Paths, Zoning) before incurring the cost of processing documents.
Phase 2 (Asset Level): A deep-dive analysis engine that processes the "Sweat Equity" potential and legal risks only for properties that survive Phase 1.
1. System Architecture: The "Street-First" Funnel
To optimize for speed and cost, the architecture enforces a "Fail Fast" mechanism. We do not waste GPU cycles or API credits analyzing a contract if the property is under a flight path.
1.1 The "Gatekeeper" Module (Street Level Logic)
This module runs instantly when an address is entered or a listing URL is scraped.

"Kill Criteria" Threshold
Social Housing Density
Source: ABS TableBuilder API (Census Data).

Method: Map Property Lat/Long -> ABS Mesh Block/SA1 -> Query "Landlord Type: State Authority".
>15% density in immediate SA1 block triggers "Manual Review".
Aeronautical Noise
Source: Airservices Australia (WFS Overlay) or local council GIS.

Method: Point-in-Polygon check against ANEF 20+ contours.
ANEF > 20 or N70 > 20 (flights/day) = AUTO KILL.
Flood & Bushfire
Source: Geoscape API / State Planning WFS.

Method: Check 1% AEP Flood Extent and BAL Zones.
1% AEP Flood = AUTO KILL.

BAL-40/FZ = Red Flag (Cost buffer required).
Zoning Mismatch
Source: VicPlan API / NSW ePlanning Spatial Services.

Method: Verify Zone Code (e.g., R2, RGZ) matches intended strategy.
High Density Adjacent = Flag (Privacy risk).

1.2 The "Analyst" Module (Asset Level Logic)
Only if the Gatekeeper returns "GO", the system ingests the data room (Contract, Floorplan, Pest Report).

Technical Implementation
Logic / Prompt Engineering
Sweat Equity Detector
Model: GPT-4o (Vision) + LayoutLM.

Input: Marketing Floorplan Image.

Task: Identifying "Lazy Space".
Prompt: "Analyze this floorplan. Identify laundries >5sqm, enclosed sunrooms, or oversized hallways that could be converted into a bathroom or bedroom. Calculate potential ROI based on bedroom differential."
Structural Risk
Model: Custom YOLOv8 (Vision).

Input: Pest/Building Report Photos.

Task: Defect Classification.
Detect: Major Crack (>2mm), Water Stain, Mould, Salt Damp.

Logic: If "Termite Barrier" is missing in Section 32 AND "Termite Damage" detected in photos = HIGH RISK.
Legal "Red Team"
Model: RAG Pipeline (Pinecone + Claude 3.5 Sonnet).

Input: Contract of Sale / Section 32.

Task: Clause Extraction.
Extract: "Special Conditions", "Easements", "Covenants".

Logic: Flag any special condition that "Waives Cooling Off" or "Accepts Property As-Is".

2. Technical Stack & Development Roadmap
Phase 1: The "Intelligence" Dashboard (Weeks 1-6)
Goal: Build the "Street Level" Gatekeeper.
Backend: Python (FastAPI).
Database: PostgreSQL (PostGIS enabled for geospatial queries).
Integrations:
Mapbox: For visualizing the "Street Level" risk layers (Social housing heatmaps, Flight paths).
Domain/RealEstate.com.au Scraper: To auto-feed listings into the funnel.
Deliverable: A web portal where an analyst pastes a link, and gets a "Go/No-Go" result in 10 seconds.
Phase 2: The "Document" Engine (Weeks 7-14)
Goal: Automate the Asset Level review.
OCR: Deploy Azure AI Document Intelligence (Layout Model) to handle the complex tables in Section 32s (Council rates, Title coordinates).
RAG Core: Setup Pinecone (Vector DB) with metadata filtering.
Chunking Strategy: "Parent-Child" chunking. Chunk by legal clause (Child), but retrieve the full page context (Parent) for the LLM to ensure no context is lost.
Deliverable: The system can now read a 150-page PDF and answer: "Is there a caveat on the title?" and "Are there illegal works?"
Phase 3: The "Sweat Equity" Vision (Weeks 15-20)
Goal: Implement the "Value Add" logic.
Vision Model: Fine-tune a vision model on floorplans to recognize "Walls to remove" or "Rooms to split".
Feasibility Script: A Python script that takes the "Renovation Suggestions" from the AI and applies a cost matrix (e.g., Bathroom addition = $25k) to update the yield forecast.
Deliverable: A "Potential Value" score on the dashboard.
3. User Interface (UI): The "Mission Control"
The UI must reflect the Military Command aesthetic and workflow.
Screen 1: The Situation Room (Map View)
Visual: A map of the target suburb overlaid with "Enemy Forces" (Public Housing clusters, Flood Zones, Main Roads).
Interaction: Clicking a property runs the "Gatekeeper".
Feedback: Properties turn Green (Viable Target) or Red (Mission Abort) instantly.
Screen 2: The Target Dossier (Property View)
Layout: Three-column view.
Left: The Facts (extracted data: Price, Yield, Land Size).
Center: The Evidence (PDF viewer with "Red Flags" highlighted in neon).
Right: The Sweat Equity Plan (AI-generated renovation concepts: "Convert laundry to Bed 4 -> +$50/wk rent").
Screen 3: The Execution Order (Report)
Action: "Generate IC Paper".
Output: A pre-formatted PDF investment memo that includes the "Pre-Mortem" analysis (e.g., "Primary risk is interest rate exposure; mitigated by 6.5% yield").
4. "Red Flag" & Kill Criteria Configuration
To strictly adhere to the Pathway methodology, we will hard-code these "Kill Criteria" into the backend logic:
The "Cluster" Kill: If >20% of the street is owned by the Department of Housing -> Stop Process.
The "Noise" Kill: If N70 > 20 flights -> Stop Process.
The "Title" Kill: If Title Search reveals "Life Estate" or "Company Share" (hard to finance) -> Flag for Senior Review.
The "Cashflow" Kill: If Gross Yield < 4% (unless explicitly a "Capital Growth" play) -> Warning.
5. Next Steps for Development Team
Data Procurement: Immediately acquire the ABS SA1 Shapefiles (Census Data) and Airservices Australia ANEF Data (usually free/open government data).
Prototype the Gatekeeper: Build a simple script that takes an address and checks it against the Flood and Social Housing datasets. This delivers immediate value before the complex AI is built.
Legal Template Sourcing: Gather 50 past "successful" and "failed" Section 32s to test the RAG system against known ground truths.
